    <h1>Working with Manuscripts</h1>
    <h2>Creating a new manuscrupt</h2>
        <p>To create a new manuscript, choose 'New Manuscript' from the file menu. Manuscripts can also be created from a folder document view.</p>
    <h2>The manuscript editor pane</h2>
        <img src="manuscript_pane.png" />
        <h3>A - Scene List</h3>
            <p>Shows all the scenes in the manuscript. Displays their name, tags, and wordcount.</p>
            <p>Click the empty space in the 'C' column to choose the scene's color.</p>
        <h3>B - Scene Filter</h3>
            <p>Type in this box to filter scenes by tag.</p>
            <p>The X button clears the current filter.</p>
            <p>The refresh button re-applies the filter, in case scene tags have changed.</p>
        <h3>C - Collapse Panes</h3>
            <p>Use these buttons to show or hide the scene list or scene editor.</p>
        <h3>D - Scene Editor</h3>
            <p>This text editor has the same features as a text document editor.</p>
    <h2>Adding scenes to a manuscript</h2>
        <p>Right click on the scene list and choose 'new scene'. The new scene is added after the selected scene or at the end of the manuscript.</p>
    <h2>Renaming scenes</h2>
        <p>Find the scene in the scene list. Click the name to begin renaming the scene.</p>
    <h2>Reordering scenes</h2>
        <p>Click and drag scenes to reorder them. The scene will be reinsterted after the scene it is dropped on.</p>
    <h2>Tagging and filtering scenes</h2>
        <p>Edit a scene's tag text in the scene editor, using the text box directly below the scene's title.</p>
        <p>Use the filter box to display only those scenes that contain the text within their tag text.</p>
    <h2>Extracting a manuscript</h2>
        <p>To be implemented</p>
    <h2>Manuscript word count</h2>
        <p>You can take the word count of a manuscript the same as any other document.</p>
        <p>Only the words actually in the scene's prose are counted. Names and tags are ignored.</p>
    <h2>Manuscripts on disc</h2>
        <p>Manuscripts are stored as JSON. This is a plain-text format, which means your data is never locked behind a binary barrier. While the text may not be immediately useable (as your prose will be heavily escaped to support the JSON format), your manuscript can be recovered from this file with tools no more sophisticated than Notepad.</p>
